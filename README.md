# Movie Explorer

**Movie Explorer** is a React-based web application that lets you explore movies, search for your favorite films, and add them to a favorites list. Built with the TMDB API, this app provides features like browsing popular movies, searching by title, and managing a personal collection of favorite movies.

## Features

- üîç **Search for Movies**: Easily search for movies by title.
- ‚ù§Ô∏è **Favorites Management**: Add or remove movies to/from your favorites list.
- üåü **Popular Movies**: View a list of popular movies on the homepage, fetched from the TMDB API.
- ‚ö° **State Management**: Uses React Context for managing the favorites list globally across the app.
- üíæ **Persistent Favorites**: Your favorite movies are stored in local storage, so they persist even when the app is reloaded.

## Technologies Used

- **TMDB API**: To fetch movie data (popular and search-based).
- **React Router**: For navigation between different pages (Home and Favorites).
